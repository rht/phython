FormCalc 6.0 README file

FormCalc is a Mathematica package for the calculation of tree-level
and one-loop Feynman diagrams.  It reads diagrams generated with
FeynArts 3 and returns the results in a way well suited for further
numerical (or analytical) evaluation.

Installation notes for the impatient:

- unpack the archive FormCalc-m.n.tar.gz (presumably you did
  this already or else you wouldn't be reading this file),

- run ./compile to compile the C programs needed by FormCalc.

You can find the complete manual in FC6Guide.ps.gz.

The latest version of FormCalc can be downloaded from
http://www.feynarts.de/formcalc.


Enjoy!
