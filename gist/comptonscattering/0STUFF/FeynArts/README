FeynArts 3 README file

FeynArts is a Mathematica package for the generation and
visualization of Feynman diagrams and amplitudes.

To install FeynArts, unpack the archive FeynArts-3.3.tar.gz in
a directory.  FeynArts requires Mathematica 3 or higher.

For Mathematica versions less than 4.2, the J/Link package and
a Java Runtime Environment need to be installed to be able to
use the topology editor of FeynArts.  Both ingredients can be
obtained free of charge from

http://www.wolfram.com/solutions/mathlink/jlink     (J/Link),
http://java.sun.com/j2se                            (Java).

Installing a Java VM may not even be necessary, as many systems
(e.g. Windows) have it pre-installed.  Follow the instructions
that come with J/Link for installation on the various platforms.

More detailed instructions can be found in the manual, in the file
FA3Guide.ps.gz.  The latest version of FeynArts can be downloaded
from http://www.feynarts.de.

Enjoy!
